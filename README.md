## 📌 Overview
Restaurant Management System is a complete web-based solution developed to automate and streamline the daily operations of a restaurant. It simplifies important tasks such as ordering, personalising menus, managing stock, and taking table reservations. Thanks to this technology, staff working in a restaurant can readily receive orders, monitor table availability, manage kitchen tasks, and monitor ingredient quantities all down from a unified platform. Core order management, table management, menu administration, bill and payment handling, stock management, and role-based user permissions (such as waiter, manager, and chef) modules make up the software. Built using enterprise-class technologies such as Java EE, Servlets, JSP, JDBC, and MySQL, the system incorporates a modular and scalable design, making it easily maintainable and supporting future expansion. This solution streamlines overall customer experience, fast-tracks service delivery, and minimizes human errors with automation of restaurant functions. Additionally, it also gives actionable insights with analytics and reporting features.
